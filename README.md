##Info

Hi! ðŸ‘‹
My name is RÃºben Miguel AraÃºjo de Sousa and this is my first real project in github. I had already made some project while using github in an internship I had that consisted in creating websites and do "branding" for companies and I also used in school, but in both times I had very bad knowledge of how to use it. Right now, in my second year of school, I have been learning more from Github and I found out we can host a website through Github Pages. Since I found that out, I decided to use the host website to place my CV online.
